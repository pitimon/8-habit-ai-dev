# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A **Claude Code plugin** (not a runnable application). No build system, no dependencies, no tests — the entire plugin is structured markdown files that Claude Code loads at runtime. The plugin provides a 7-step workflow discipline based on Covey's 8 Habits, designed to replace "vibe coding" with structured AI-assisted development.

**Install**: `claude plugin marketplace add pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev && claude plugin install 8-habit-ai-dev@pitimon-8-habit-ai-dev`

## Architecture

The plugin has three loading mechanisms with distinct timing:

1. **`rules/effective-development.md`** — Auto-loaded into every Claude Code session (via Claude's rules system). Contains the full 8-Habit playbook with Rules, Anti-patterns, and Checkpoints per habit.
2. **`hooks/session-start.sh`** — Runs at SessionStart (registered in `hooks/hooks.json`). Prints a ≤300-token reminder of the 7-step workflow. Must stay concise — this is injected into every conversation.
3. **`skills/*/SKILL.md`** — Loaded on-demand when user invokes `/requirements`, `/design`, `/breakdown`, `/build-brief`, `/review-ai`, `/deploy-guide`, `/monitor-setup`, or `/cross-verify`.

**On-demand loading**: Skills reference habit content via `Load ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/habits/h*.md` — the habit files are NOT loaded at session start. This keeps the token budget lean.

## Skill Authoring Conventions

Each skill file (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name> # Must match directory name
description: > # Multi-line, explains when to use
user-invocable: true # Always true for workflow skills
argument-hint: "[description]" # Shown in skill list
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Glob", "Grep"] # Bash only when needed (e.g., review-ai)
---
```

Body pattern: Habit mapping → Process steps → When to Skip → H\* Checkpoint → Load directive for the full habit file.

## Key Conventions

- **Skills are read-only guidance** — they tell Claude how to approach a task, they do not modify files themselves
- **`habits/`, `guides/`, `rules/` are reference content** — never generated or modified by skills
- **Agent (`agents/8-habit-reviewer.md`)** uses model `sonnet` with read-only tools (`Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`) — it analyzes and reports, never edits
- **Plugin metadata** lives in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin config) and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (marketplace listing)
- **Session hook budget**: `hooks/session-start.sh` output must stay ≤300 tokens

## Skills → Habits Mapping

| Skill            | Step | Habit                 | Purpose                       |
| ---------------- | ---- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/requirements`  | 1    | H2 Begin with End     | Define done before starting   |
| `/design`        | 2    | H8 Find Your Voice    | Human decides architecture    |
| `/breakdown`     | 3    | H3 First Things First | Atomic tasks, no scope creep  |
| `/build-brief`   | 4    | H5 Understand First   | Read code before writing      |
| `/review-ai`     | 5    | H4 Win-Win            | Actionable feedback           |
| `/deploy-guide`  | 6    | H1 Be Proactive       | Staging first, rollback ready |
| `/monitor-setup` | 7    | H7 Sharpen the Saw    | Invest in observability       |
| `/cross-verify`  | All  | H1-H8                 | 17-question checklist         |
