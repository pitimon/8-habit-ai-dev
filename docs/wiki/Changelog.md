# Changelog

Release history for `8-habit-ai-dev`. This page summarizes notable changes; the authoritative sources are [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (v2.3.0+), the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/releases), and the [git tag history](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/tags).

> Full detail for v2.3.0 and later lives in the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). This wiki page summarizes recent versions and keeps v2.2.0 and earlier for continuity.

## v2.10.0 — Progressive-Disclosure SKILL.md Split (April 2026)

Refactor the 3 largest skills into `SKILL.md + reference.md + examples.md` triads per [ADR-009](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-009-skill-split-convention.md). Creates headroom below the F3 word-budget fitness ceiling so future feature additions don't break the validator. Pattern sourced from external research (`shanraisshan/claude-code-best-practice`), filtered through plugin-boundary audit.

- **ADR-009** — codifies Load-directive mechanism (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` inline paths), naming convention, and when-to-apply threshold (SKILL >1500 words). Reuses existing Check 8 for sibling existence — no new fitness function needed for that.
- **F6 (Check 9b)** — soft word-budget warning for `reference.md` / `examples.md` (5000-word soft limit).
- **`using-8-habits`** split: SKILL 1990 → 1094 words; `reference.md` holds the full 17-skill inventory + cross-plugin composition tables; `examples.md` holds the password-reset onboarding walkthrough.
- **`eu-ai-act-check`** split: SKILL 1989 → 908 words; `reference.md` holds the full 9-obligation checklist (25 MUST / 27 SHOULD / 8 COULD items) with article/paragraph references. No `examples.md` (pure-reference skill).
- **`calibrate`** split: SKILL 1774 → 1161 words; `reference.md` holds the scoring rubric + profile-write procedure; `examples.md` holds 4 sample profiles (one per maturity level).
- **Content validator triad-awareness** — Checks 15 and 18 in `tests/validate-content.sh` now search the SKILL + reference + examples triad as a unit, so content moved to sibling files still satisfies anti-drift and tier-count assertions.
- **Rejected from this release** — 27-event hook catalog (referred to [`pitimon/claude-governance#22`](https://github.com/pitimon/claude-governance/issues/22)), Idea B (auto-load `user-invocable: false` habits), Idea D (parallel `/cross-verify` dispatch), F3 WARN→FAIL upgrade. Rejection rationale documented in root `CHANGELOG.md`.

Fitness receipts: `validate-structure.sh` 243/0, `test-skill-graph.sh` PASS, `validate-content.sh` 183/0 with 0 fitness breaches. Release shipped via [Issue #125](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/125) / [PR #126](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/pull/126) in a single clean forward pass.

## v2.9.0 — Deep-Project Inspired Improvements (April 2026)

Three features inspired by comparison research against `piercelamb/deep-project`. Cross-verified (14/17), advisor-reviewed, 8-habit QA passed (13/17 → 15/17).

- **Interview protocol for `/requirements`** ([#118](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/118)) — new `guides/templates/interview-protocol.md` gives structured conversation scaffolding (Quick/Standard/Deep depth) for discovering requirements before EARS criteria. Replaces the "ask the user 5 questions" default with a better-shaped discovery flow.
- **Workflow step awareness in session-start hook** ([#119](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/119)) — `hooks/session-start.sh` now surfaces a workflow step cue so partial chains can resume across sessions without per-skill rework.
- **Machine-readable structured output blocks** ([#120](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/120)) — new `guides/structured-output-protocol.md` defines `<!-- SKILL_OUTPUT:... END_SKILL_OUTPUT -->` HTML comment blocks at the end of `/requirements`, `/breakdown`, and `/review-ai`. Enables `/cross-verify` to auto-check scope alignment (task_count vs ears_count ≤ 3× ratio) and review coverage, reducing manual re-reading of prior-step artifacts.

## v2.8.0 — Claude Code Architecture Insights (April 2026)

Production patterns from Anthropic's Claude Code internals (reverse-engineered in ["Claude Code from Source"](https://github.com/alejandrobalderas/claude-code-from-source)) adapted into 4 existing skills as workflow guidance.

- **`/build-brief` context compression awareness** ([#114](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/114)) — step 6 "Context survival" for briefs that survive the 4-layer compression pipeline
- **`/design` sticky latch principle** ([#116](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/116)) — step 5 "Sticky decisions" with rework-level classification table
- **`/reflect` lesson consolidation** ([#113](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/113)) — Step 7 + `/reflect consolidate` argument with 4-phase dream-inspired cycle
- **`/breakdown` fork agent pattern** ([#115](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/115)) — step 5 "Token-efficient parallel design" with ~90% cache hit guidance

## v2.7.1 — Review Discipline Refinement (April 2026)

Small post-milestone patch adding two disciplines to `/review-ai` after a cost/benefit audit against `addyosmani/agent-skills` (MIT). Scope deliberately minimal — only one of six candidate mechanics was imported.

- **`/review-ai` Performance axis** ([#110](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/110), [PR #111](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/pull/111)) — fourth review category flagging N+1 queries, unbounded loops, missing pagination, unindexed queries, and memory leaks; same `file:line` evidence standard as the other axes
- **Review-tests-first directive** — new Process step 2 directs the reviewer to read new/changed tests before judging implementation
- **Rejections preserved in PR #111 body** — `guides/anti-rationalization.md`, `guides/red-flags.md`, `guides/google-engineering-principles.md`, `/cross-verify` Q18, and a cross-plugin hard-gate spec were all evaluated and rejected as duplicative of existing features or out-of-scope

## v2.7.0 — Reader Adoption (April 2026)

Closes the `/calibrate` feature loop by making skills read `~/.claude/habit-profile.md` via a session-start hook.

- **Hook-based verbosity adaptation** ([#96](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/96)) — `hooks/session-start.sh` emits a per-level directive into session context; 16 existing skills auto-adapt with zero file changes
- **`guides/verbosity-adaptation.md`** — canonical per-level rules with 5 skill-archetype examples
- **`tests/test-verbosity-hook.sh`** — 12-assertion regression coverage for all 8 hook branches + HABIT_QUIET opt-out + ≤300-token budget check
- **4 validators in CI, 482 total assertions** (up from 3 / 470)
- **Milestone v2.7.0 CLOSED** — Hermes-inspired feature loop (v2.6.0 + v2.7.0) complete

## v2.6.1 — Skill Effectiveness Tracking (April 2026)

- **`/reflect` Q6 Skill Effectiveness signal** ([#92](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/92)) — 6th retro question captures "most useful" and "least useful/confusing" skill
- **`SKILL-EFFECTIVENESS.md`** (repo root) — maintainer-curated trend tracker; H7 applied to the plugin itself
- **`guides/templates/lesson-template.md`** — new `## Skill effectiveness` section for consistent Q6 capture
- **Fix**: SIGPIPE flake in `validate-content.sh` F3 extractor — replaced `sed | head` with pipe-safe awk

## v2.6.0 — Hermes-Inspired Improvements (April 2026)

- **`/calibrate` skill + habit-profile schema v1** ([#90](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/90), [ADR-008](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-008-user-maturity-calibration-design.md)) — 5-7 question self-assessment writing `~/.claude/habit-profile.md` with dominant-level scoring
- **`guides/habit-profile-schema.md`** — public schema contract (YAML + markdown body, versioned via `schema-version`)
- **Persistent reflection artifacts** ([#88](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/issues/88)) — `/reflect` writes lessons to `~/.claude/lessons/`; `/research` and `/build-brief` read them before starting work
- **`guides/habit-nudges.md`** + **ADR-007** — nudge spec (hook delegated to claude-governance) + agentskills.io NO-GO decision
- **Skill count: 16 → 17** (`/calibrate` added)

## v2.5.0 — Testing & Discoverability (April 2026)

- **`tests/test-skill-graph.sh`** — DAG validator for `prev-skill` / `next-skill` chains (#79): cycles, dangling refs, symmetric edges, orphans
- **`hooks/pre-commit.sh.example`** — template running `/review-ai` on staged files (opt-in, not auto-installed)
- **Bidirectional wiki ↔ skills linking** (#81) — each workflow skill has a `## Further Reading` section linking to its wiki page
- CI now runs 3 validators; 443 total assertions

## v2.4.1 — Honest Correction (April 2026)

Same-day correction after comparing `/brainstorm` to `superpowers:brainstorming`.

- **Removed `/brainstorm` skill** (breaking) — superpowers' 500+ line hard-gate discipline suite is a better fit; `/research` now references it for fuzzy problem statements
- **`HABIT_QUIET=1` opt-out** for `hooks/session-start.sh` — users who internalize the workflow can silence the reminder
- **"Core 5" tier** in `/using-8-habits` — 80/20 reality acknowledgment
- [ADR-006](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-006-audience-honesty-and-opt-out.md) — audience-honesty + opt-out + "check peer plugins before building parity" lesson

## v2.4.0 — Workflow Completions (April 2026)

- **`/brainstorm`** (Step 0a, later removed in v2.4.1) — 5 Whys, alternative framings, hidden assumptions
- **EARS-notation in `/requirements`** — 5 structured acceptance criteria templates from Rolls-Royce (Mavin et al. 2009)
- **`/using-8-habits`** — onboarding meta-skill with decision tree and complete walkthrough example
- Validators: +52 assertions, anti-drift check ensures meta-skill references every directory skill
- Fix: `validate-structure.sh` regex allowing digits in skill names

## v2.3.0 — EU AI Act Compliance Toolkit (April 2026)

Flagship blue-ocean feature: first Claude Code plugin with explicit EU AI Act compliance toolkit, shipped ~4 months before 2 August 2026 enforcement.

- **`/eu-ai-act-check`** — 9-obligation tiered checklist (25 MUST + 27 SHOULD + 8 COULD) covering Articles 9-15
- **`/ai-dev-log`** + **`scripts/generate-ai-dev-log.sh`** — AI-assisted development log from `git log` + Co-Authored-By trailers (4 modes: markdown/json/summary/out)
- **`/design` Step 5** — Article 14 human-oversight 5-capability checkpoint (Understand / Automation bias / Interpret / Override / Stop button)
- **`docs/research/eu-ai-act-obligations.md`** — primary-source research with Verified Quotes for all 7 articles
- **[ADR-005](https://github.com/pitimon/8-habit-ai-dev/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-005-eu-ai-act-toolkit.md)** + **Plugin Boundary section** in `CLAUDE.md` — documents complementary relationship with [`pitimon/claude-governance`](https://github.com/pitimon/claude-governance)
- Version file convention corrected to **4 files** (added `SELF-CHECK.md`)
- Fix: `validate-structure.sh` SIGPIPE race replaced `sed | head` with awk

## Versioning policy

This plugin follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Major** — breaking change to skill interfaces, skill removal, or workflow restructuring
- **Minor** — new skills, new habits content, backward-compatible additions
- **Patch** — documentation fixes, typo corrections, clarifications

Version is tracked in four files that must bump together (enforced by `tests/validate-structure.sh`):

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `README.md` (badge + footer)
- `SELF-CHECK.md` header
